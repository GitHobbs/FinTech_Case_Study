# Synthetix: Decentralized Derivatives
## Overview and Origin
Synthetix is a decentralzied finance protocol built on the Ethereum network that allows users to mint and trade derivative asset products called "synths".  Synthetix was initially founded as a stablecoin issuer called Havven by Austrailian entrepreneur Kain Warwick in 2017.  The project has dramatically evolved in scope and size ever since, raising $46.1 million over a two year period, primarily via an Initial Coin Offering (or "ICO") in 2018 ($30 million). Since the ICO, venture capital has been provided by Coinbase Ventures, IOSG Ventures, Paradigm and Framework Ventures.<br><br>

Synthetix was one of the first Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects and was developed as a means to provide exposure to a wide variety of "real world" assets such as commodities, currencies, stocks or major indices on the blockchain. These assets can be purchased with no slippage and no need for a counter party.  Synthetic assets are simply minted, burned or exchanged on the protocol.  

## Business Activities
In order to understand the significance of a project like this, it is important to explain the need for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols in general.  A large portion of the world has little or no access to financial services like interest-bearing accounts, stock and commodity trading, derivaties (such as options and futures) or forex markets.  With DeFi, however, anyone with an internet connection can take part in the financial system that many of us in more developed countries have enjoyed for many years.  Now, imagine someone in a small village in East Africa who wants to gain exposure to Indian Rupees, silver or Apple stock.  This would be nearly impossible without the creation of DeFi and, more specifically, Synthetic assets on the blockchain.<br><br>

It is also important to understand what derivatives are and what they are used for. The term "derivative" is defined by Investopedia as "a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on an underlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark. A derivative is set between two or more parties that can trade on an exchange or over-the-counter (OTC)."  In other words, derivatives are complex financial instruments that fluctuate with the value of an asset without having to own the asset itself.  Common examples are options and futures. They can be used to hedge risk, transfer risk, add leverage to a position or simply speculate on price movement.<br><br>

Because there is such a wide variety of derivative products, there are three inherent risks involved:
* *Counter-party risk* - The risk that one party in a transaction defaults.
* *Liquidity risk* - Without significant liquidity, widened bid-ask spreads can be a barrier to entry.
* *Speculation risk* - Unhedged speculation on a volatile asset, particularly when leverage is used, can cause disatrous loss.
<br><br>

The first two types of risk can create a massive barrier to entry, particularly with those in under-developed areas of the world.  Again, imagine this same East African villager who wants to purchase a futures contract on wheat in order to hedge against fluctuations in the market price of thier crops.  They can't open an account on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange which provides them with a solid counter-party (market maker) and ample liquidity.  They would need to contact a broker who would then need to make an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction that involves multiple counter-parties and outrageous fees.<br><br>

This is where Synthetix comes in. Anyone using the protocol can simply "mint" a tokenized asset that provides exposure to a wide variety of real world assets with no counter-party and infinite liquidity. Swapping between "synths" is as simple as burning one token and minting another.<br><br>

So, how does this work?  Well, that's rather complicated.  According to the Synthetix Lite Paper, "These synthetic assets are collateralized by the Synthetix Network Token (SNX) which when locked in the contract enables the issuance of synthetic assets (Synths). This pooled collateral model allows users to perform conversions between Synths directly with the smart contract, avoiding the need for counterparties. This mechanism solves the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by DEX’s (decentralized exchanges)."  In other words, holders of the SNX token can "stake" their SNX, which involves depositing it into a smart contract and minting sUSD (Synthetix's version of a stablecoin, which is pegged 1:1 with the US dollar).  In exchange for providing this liquidity, SNX token holders receive two types of rewards:
* Staking rewards (denominated in SNX) from inflation of the token supply
* A portion of fees derived from use of the protocol

 This is, in theory, how the valution of the SNX token is derived.  However, speculation has recently caused massive fluctuations in the market price.<br><br>

Synthetix uses decentralized oracles (provided by Chainlink) to track prices of the assets represented. This gives users access to real time market prices and exchange rates. Also, according to Messari.io, "The Synthetix protocol has also become a core building block for many other use cases in crypto. New protocols are using it to build their own tools and use cases for users. The ecosystem today boasts a decentralized exchange with perpetual futures (Kwenta), a decentralized options automated market maker (Lyra), on top of which an algorithmic options vault has been built, a Prediction Market (Aelin), and more. Synthetix also has integrations with many of DeFi’s core primitives." <br><br>

When thinking about the market reach of a protocol like this, the potential for growth becomes clear.  According to Investopedia, the derivatives market is estimated to be worth over $1 quadrillion on the high end.  Then, when you realize that only a small percentage of people in the world currently have access to these markets, the total addressable market becomes staggeringly large.  If Synthetix can only command a small fraction of this market, the potential for growth is incomprehensible.  Also, the idea of being able to trade large quantities of derivative assets with low fees, infinite liquidity and zero slippage can attract entities with very large amounts of capital as synthetic assets could be competitive with the largest derivative exchanges in the world.  Large corporations, hedge funds, investment banks and government treasuries are just a few of the instututions that could benefit.<br><br>

## Landscape<br><br>

Blockchain/cryptocurrencies and particularly DeFi applications, are a relatively new development and innovation is moving at a blistering pace.  Since this is a decentralized protocol, there is no risk of bankruptcy or insolvency as there is with centralized companies.  That being said, there are numerous barriers to adoption of Synthetix by large institutions.<br><br>

The primary risk to adoption is government regulation.  After the collapse of major centralized exchanges like FTX and BlockFi and stablecoin issuers like Luna, the need for government regulation in the cryptocurrency markets has become apparent.  Various governments, including the United States, are bound to recongize synthetic assets as securities and will want to regulate them as such. This is a risk that affects most or all of the major Decentralized Finance applications being built on the blockchain.<br><br>

Besides competing with the major centralized derivative exchanges, Synthetix also faces challenges from competitng protocols within the blockchain/cryptocurrency domain.  I have highlighted three of them below:<br><br>

1. **Mirror Protocol** -  Without going into too much detail, Mirror protocol is almost identical to Synthetix in terms of its mechanics. The primary difference is that Synthetix operates on the Ethereum and Optimism blockchains while Mirror is built on the Terra blockchain which is part of the previously referenced Luna ecosystem.<br><br>

2.  **dYdX** - dYdX is a popular protocol that uses derivative products to allow users to buy on margin and use extreme amounts of leverage.  They also allow for trading of "perpetual futures" (futures contracts with no expiratiion) which is a popular product amongst speculators.  dYdX primarily competes with Synthetix's leveraged trading and futures products, but does not offer synthetic assets.<br><br>

3.  **GMX** - GMX is similar to dYdX in that it allows users to trade perpetual futures and make leveraged trades but does not issue synthetic assets.

It is important to note that Synthetix does not itself offer perpetual future contracts.  *Kwenta.io*, which is built on top of Synthetix protocol has this product offering.  But, the liquidity and mechanics of the Synthetix platform makes this possible, and fees from the Kwent.io exchange flow to SNX token holders.

The trends and innovations happening in the DeFi space are too many to count as new project spring up every week.  However, there are a few new products that can be built upon protocols like Synthetix such as atomic swaps, which help users execute large-scale trades between different assets by integrating with large decentralized exchanges like Curve Finance and 1 Inch.<br><br>

## Results

Tracking crypto and blockchain metrics can be as tricky as keeping up with the numerous projects coming out of the pipeline.  The market cap of the project's token is often used, but it can be misleading due to the sheer amount of speculation creating volatility in the market prices. Here is a list showing how Synthetix stacks up to the compeitition on this metric (Rankings include all cryptocurrencies). <br><br> 

* #83 GMX $392 million
* #84 SNX $378 million
* #140 dYdX $193 million
* #659 Mirror $17 million
<br><br>

Another popular metric used to determine the success of DeFi platforms is total fees generated (7 day average) since fees are generally returned to token holders.  Synthetix and it's competitors currently rank as follows:  
<br><br>

* #4 GMX $450,767
* #17 SNX $36,894
* Not Listed - dYdX & Mirror Protocol<br><br>

Other popular crypto metrics include price-to-sales ratio, total value locked, staking yields, token movements on centralized exchanges and unique address growth rate.  However, these metrics don't necessarily apply to protocols like Synthetix because it's either a) too small or b) doesn't operate in a way that would make these types of metrics applicable.<br><br>

## Recommendations<br><br>

When I'm thinking about recommendations for this protocol, I don't necessarily think of additional products or services they could provide to gain market share.  Instead, I'm thinking about addressing the primary risks to their very existence.  The bottom line for Synthetix is that it needs to grow its useage (and terefore, fees generated) by attracting large institutional users such as banks, government treasuries, and hedge funds.  And, in order for one of these large institutions to become a first-mover, Synthetix needs to be compliant with any  regulatory frameworks that currently exist or may exist in the future.<br><br>

Since it is very likely that synths will be considered securities by the SEC, they need to work hand in hand with US lawmakers on creating this regulatory framework and adhering to it in advance so as to avoid scrutiny.  The major financial institutions are waiting for the green light from regulators before they will even consider purusing Decentralized Finance protocols as a means to increase efficiency and cut costs.  The good news is that many institutions are aware of the benefits decentralized financial applications can provide.  The bad news is that we could be months if not years away from reliable legal framework with which these protocols can comply, and much can change between now and then.<br><br>

The landscape of DeFi and derivatives protocols changes almost daily and the future is murky at best.  While this can be fun for those who are interested in tracking the rapid innovation in this massively distruptive environment, it is impossible to know who will come out on top.  However, Synthetix has the technology, the leadership and the first-mover advantage to change the way derivative insturments are traded well into the future.<br><br>
